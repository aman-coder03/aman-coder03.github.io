Hello reader! I am a pre-final year Computer Science student specializing in **Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning**, with hands-on experience in **NLP systems, automation pipelines, and full-stack AI applications**.

I have worked on building **production-grade ML systems** from data processing and model fine-tuning to deployment and workflow automation across academic and real-world environments. My interests include **transformer-based NLP architectures, AI-driven automation, and scalable data systems**.

Beyond technical work, I bring strong **leadership, discipline, and decision-making skills under pressure**, demonstrated through founding and leading student organizations and being **recommended via the SSB for Officer Entry** into the Indian Armed Forces.
